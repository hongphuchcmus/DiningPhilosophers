You can direcly run the `main.exe` file to quickly see the result of the program on Windows.  
You can, however, build the program using the following command:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main -lpthread
```
Then run the program using:
```bash
./main
```
Make sure that you have the GCC compiler installed on your system. To check if you have it installed, run:
```bash
g++ --version
```
